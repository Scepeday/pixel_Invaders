# Pixel_Invaders

A simple **Space Invaders–style** arcade game built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only**

## 🕹️ Overview

You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and must shoot down waves of invading aliens before they reach you or the ground.  
The game runs completely in the browser using:

- **HTML5** for the game layout
- **CSS3** for visuals
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for game logic, collision detection and input handling

This project is great as an example of building a small game with **pure JS**, using only the DOM.

## ✨ Features

- Player spaceship that can move left and right
- Shoot projectiles to destroy enemies
- Multiple alien invaders moving across and down the screen
- Lives or limited attempts
- Score tracking
- Game over and restart

> _Note: You can customize all of these in the source code (speed, number of enemies, etc.)._


## 🎮 Controls

Default controls:

- **A / D keys** – Move the ship left and right  
- **Spacebar** – Shoot  
- **P** - Pause the game

You can change the keys in the JavaScript file if you prefer different controls.
